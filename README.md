Example project for [Tabletop Playground](https://tabletop-playground.com/) that adds a scripting AI to the game

The chess ai has been taken as is from the following github project:
* Original project: https://github.com/lhartikk/simple-chess-ai
* Related blogpost: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977/

Note that the search depth has been reduced to lead to faster turn calculation times at the cost of worse AI moves
